	<h2>The Clod and the Pebble</h2>
	<p>
	"Love seeketh not itself to please,
	Nor for itself hath any care,
	But for another gives its ease,
	And builds a Heaven in Hell's despair."
	</p>
	<p>
	So sung a little Clod of Clay
	Trodden with the cattle's feet,
	But a Pebble of the brook
	Warbled out these metres meet:
	</p>
	<p>
	"Love seeketh only self to please,
	To bind another to its delight,
	Joys in another's loss of ease,
	And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite."
	</p>
